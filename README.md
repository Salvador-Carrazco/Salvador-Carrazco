### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an application to read blueprints. This application will read the blueprints and, 
  based on users' inputs, give them an estimate on how much they should bid the job for. This idea came to me after 
  talking with my father. If he is not physically working in the field, he is at home bidding jobs so that they 
  can keep work coming in. As a small business owner, he would rather spend his time bidding on jobs than paying someone to do so.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning and working on a few projects. To learn a new language, I'm taking a course on Udemy for C++. 
  I'm working on a mobile application that will teach me a new framework (React native) and GraphQL.  

- ðŸ‘¯   Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on imaginative projects that merge technology with artistic expression across various mediums, 
  from digital art installations to interactive storytelling experiences. Whether it's exploring the intersection of augmented reality 
  and performance art or experimenting with AI-generated music compositions, I'm excited to join forces with fellow creatives who share
  a passion for pushing the boundaries of innovation in the arts. If you're interested in co-creating immersive experiences that captivate 
  audiences and ignite their imagination, let's connect and brainstorm ideas together!

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m seeking help refining my application's algorithm for blueprint analysis and optimizing the user interface for better user experience.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my journey from being a field worker to developing tech 
    solutions for the construction industry. I'm eager to share how my personal experiences have shaped my entrepreneurial endeavors.

âš¡ Fun fact: During my time in the Navy, I had the incredible opportunity to live in Japan, 
immersing myself in its rich culture and traditions. From savoring authentic sushi in Tokyo 
to practicing martial arts in Kyoto, my experience abroad broadened my horizons and influenced my perspective on 
collaboration and innovation in both my military service and entrepreneurial pursuits.

Currently- I am looking to break into Tech. If I am not at work, I'm behind my keyboard, either coding or applying for opportunities. 
If you feel I might be a great candidate, please feel free to reach out!
